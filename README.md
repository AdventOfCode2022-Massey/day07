# Advent of Code 2022: Day 7
Ben and Bart Massey

---

OK, I think we're done here.

Ben has kind of dropped out at this point. I have spent
several days trying to figure out why my perfectly clean and
cromulent-looking code, which gives the right answer on the
example input for Part 1, gives a low answer for the actual
input. I have tried a bunch of approaches to diagnose this,
and nothing has worked worth a darn.

The fun has gone now. Enjoy Advent of Code!
